# Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Initiation

A nice React one page app which will help you to find Github-users' profile, repository and other useful infromation. 
The dynamic logo from FontAwsome and the navbar from the same color theme of Github. 

### Installation

Clone the repo and run "npm install" for node_modules installation. Then you can try to search your name or anyone else from the search bar! Have fun! The following version will have some improvements if needed. 

### At the end

Hope I could run some new social media platforms, while their API are not that open as Github. 
So, wish we could do something more than right now.</p>
